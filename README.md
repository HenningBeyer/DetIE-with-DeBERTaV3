# DetIE-with-DeBERTaV3

This repository contains the used Code for replacing the BERT-encoder of [DetIE](https://github.com/sberbank-ai/DetIE) with the more effective variants of RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa and DeBERTaV3.
As the used code is almost similar to the original code of DetIE only the results are published.

However, the corresponding German research paper is included as well as this actually relevant work sets the new state of the art in the area of OIE by simply using newer BERT encoder variants.
